# no_teen_sum 
# Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum.
# However, if any of the values is a teen -- in the range 13..19 inclusive -- then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens. Write a separate helper "def fix_teen(n):"that takes in an int value and returns that value fixed for the teen rule.
# In this way, you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times (i.e. "decomposition").
